odamlar
ajdaho poygasi deb atashni yoqtiradigan kichik narsa

Yo'q, hali ham sizni yomon ko'raman.
bu joyni puflaylik
puflamoq
katta gap uni qo'rqitdi, to'g'rimi?
u sizni tiriklayin ko'mishga harakat qilmadimi?
faqat bir necha soat
endi, ajdaho bu erda biroz muammo bo'lgan, lekin bu besh yil oldin bo'lgan
va, albatta, nima uchun ular unday emas
bizda maxsus otxonalar bor, siz hamma ovqatlantiradigan joylarni eyishingiz mumkin, ajdarni to'liq yuvish xizmati
hatto yong'inning oldini olish, agar men buni o'zim aytgan bo'lsam

dunyo shunchaki kattalashib ketdi
Siz bunga boshqa zarba bermoqchimisiz
bu ajoyib
endi hayratlanarli emas
bu haqiqatan ham hech qaerdan paydo bo'lmagan
biz u erda sizning yakkaxon sayohatingiz ustida ishlashimiz kerak
yakkaxon
sirg'alish
qulflangan dumi qutqarish manevralarini juda beparvo qiladi

Xo'sh, buni sinab ko'ring
Oh, siz hali ham buni his qilyapsizmi?
butun qalbimdan pushaymon bo'ldimmi?
va xunuk
Bilasizmi, bu yuvilmaydi
nima deb o'ylaysiz?
g'alati shivirlab o'lim yoki toshlar ichida

Balki, biz nihoyat boshqa Night Furyni kuzatib boramiz

yana nima
otamdan qochish
sen buni yaxshi ko'rasan
uyingizda dahshatli dahshatlar kuylayapti
Men nonushta qilyapman, dunyo bilan hamma narsa to'g'ri deb o'ylayman, va men tushunaman

men ham o'zimdan juda ta'sirlandim

qaror qildim
sezgir
bu katta mas'uliyat
Bu so'zlar, qishloqni rejalashtirish va boshqarish - bu uning ishi
Menimcha, siz bu fikrni yo'qotdingiz

juda hayajonlangan bo'lardim
men hali ham qidiraman
Men otam emasligimni bilaman

lekin bizda hali to'ldirish uchun kvota bor
Sizningcha, bu tartibsizlikni drago Bludvistga qanday tushuntiramiz
siz aytgan biror narsa mantiqiymi?
u ertaga o'z qo'shini uchun ajdarlarning yangi partiyasini kutmoqda

siz hech qachon bu ajdarlarni ushlab turmaysiz
ehtimol u hozirgacha dunyoning chetidan uchib ketgan
Siz o'sha bolaning qishloqni boshqarishini xohlaysiz
siz hali ham pensiyani kechiktirishingiz mumkin
kim nihoyat ishga chiqishga qaror qildi
Kechirasiz, ushlab turdim
Menga aytmoqchi bo'lgan narsa?
Siz o'ylayotgan narsa unchalik emas, lekin ha
birinchi vazifasi o'z xalqi oldida
Xo'sh, biz faqat yolg'iz gaplasha olamizmi?
Hey, men sizdan oldinda edim
agar gaplasha olsak
Men baland pog'onali va katta saqlash joyiga ega yuqori o'rindiqlardan birini xohlayman
ota, bu aslida egar yasashdan ko'ra muhimroq
xalqingizga xizmat qilish borasida hech qanday vazifa juda kichik emas
siz qurbonning yana o'lishiga yo'l qo'ydingiz
siz asrab olmoqchisiz
uzoqlashing
Men sizga haqiqatan ham biz uchrashgan yangi er haqida aytib berishim kerak
biz bilish uchun atrofga yopishmadik
Bu odamlar, ayniqsa, do'stona emas edilar
Sizning Night Fury va Deadly Nadder ularni olib kelmadi
tomlarning tepasida
tepaliklar
bu bolalar tuzoqchi edi
siz ularning qal'asini ko'rishingiz kerak edi
g'alati edi
va eng yomoni, ular biz buni qildik deb o'yladilar
hamma ham bu hayot tarzini qadrlamaydi
eng yaxshisi o'zimizniki.
bundan tashqari, siz o'z vaqtingizni yanada muhimroq ishlatasiz
bir marta biz katta e'lon qilamiz
agar u ajdarimni olmoqchi bo'lsa, men uning mushtini yuzim bilan qonga to'kaman
siz shunchalik ahmoqsiz
eshiklarni muhrlab qo'ying
bo'ron eshiklarini pastga tushiring
kuting, chunki siz bilgan bir yigit uzoq mamlakatda muammo tug'dirmoqda
chunki Drago Bludvist vijdonsiz yoki rahm -shafqatsiz jinnidir
ularni qalamlariga joylashtiring
keyin u erga qaytamiz

tinchlikni saqlash bizning burchimiz

Bu shamol bilan biz Dragonga tong otguncha etib boramiz
Yaxshisi, biz bu kemani ajdarlarga to'ldiramiz va tezda
halol bo'lish vaqti emas
port choragidan tashqarida
ularga to'r, yigitlar
ularni pastga tushiring
chap tomonda

eng zo'r
Bu xo'jayinni xursand qilishi kerak
bizni kechir
ajdarlar chayqalgan joylarga unchalik ahamiyat bermaydilar
ular faqat sen bilan uchrashishadi
muammo
Agar siz yog'ochdan yasalgan qayiqlarni qilmasangiz, qanday qilib sizning suzishingiz qurolli mahbuslarga ega bo'lolmaydi, ular sizni o'zlaridan biri sifatida ko'rsalar, hatto eng mazali ajdarlarni ham o'rgatish mumkin.
u haqiqatan ham ishontira oladi
Agar siz uning sadoqatini qo'lga kiritgan bo'lsangiz, ajdaho siz uchun hech narsa qilmaydi
qarang, men qanchalik yaxshi himoya qilaman va ta'minlayman
hamma to'rlar bilan nima bor?
yaqin
olovingizni ushlab turing
biz sizni qutqarish uchun keldik
yetarli
Xo'sh, siz noto'g'ri kemani tanlamadingizmi?
bu narsani mendan oling
men buni tushundim
egarlang

Men ajdarlarimizni himoya qilishga va urushni to'xtatishga harakat qilaman
qanday qilib bu mas'uliyatsizlik
biz hammamiz duch kelgan ajdaho balosini muhokama qilish uchun boshliqlarning katta yig'ilishi bo'lib o'tdi
bizning oramizga begona erdan, izlari bilan qoplangan va ajdaho terisiga burkangan begona keldi.
izlar
taralgan
plash
u qo'lida qurol yo'q edi va ohista gapirdi
insoniyatni ajdarlarning zulmidan ozod qilishga bag'ishlangan
biz ta'zim qilib, unga ergashishni tanladik
biz ham kulib yubordik
qadar
yig'lab yubordi
tushdi
yonayotgan
Men qochgan yagona odam edim
sababsiz o'ldirgan erkaklar bilan mulohaza yuritib bo'lmaydi

qolganlarni Berkga qaytaring
Menda bir kunlik qo'zg'olon bor edi
keskin harakatlar yo'q
to'xtab tur
siz mening ajdarimni o'sha erda qoldirdingiz
u cho'kib ketadi
biz ajdarimga qaytib ketishimiz kerak
ajdaho o'g'ri
Siz haqiqatan ham meni o'sha erda xavotirga solgansiz
bo'lishi mumkinmi?
bu qanday mumkin?
siz faqat go'dak edingiz
cho'chqa boshi
xuddi onasi kabi
u ham hech qachon tura olmasdi
Aytmoqchimanki, bundan ham yomon kombinatsiya bo'lishi mumkin
qachon siz o'jar va aqlsiz bo'lganingizni o'ylaganimda
qanday aqldan ozganini tushunasizmi?
tushunish
aqldan ozgan
Siz ularni qutqardingiz
aql bovar qilmaydigan
xafa bo'lmaysiz
boshimni aylantirish, ochig'ini aytganda, biroz ko'proq
vahshiy
hushyor
aqldan ozgan
hech bo'lmaganda men zerikmayman, to'g'rimi
Xo'sh, menimcha, bu aniq bir narsa
oh, aql bovar qilmas
u, ehtimol, o'z turining oxirgisi bo'lishi mumkin
ajablanarli emas, siz juda yaxshi birga bo'ldingiz
va tortiladigan tishlar
qanday boshqargansiz
yarador
Jekning qanoti ustara bilan kesilgan edi
qo'rqqan
u meni qaytarib oldi
tez orada, uyga qaytgan har bir odamning o'z ajdarlari bor edi
agar iloji bo'lsa edi
lekin odamlar o'zgarishga qodir emas
tinchlik mumkin edi
siz yomonlashtirasiz
bu juda mashhur bo'lmagan fikr edi
beshikda
Men sizni himoya qilishga shoshildim
lekin men ko'rgan hamma narsa men ishongan narsaning isboti edi
Bu yovuz hayvon emas, balki aqlli, muloyim ijod, uning ruhi mening jonimni aks ettirardi
to'xtab tur
siz va otangiz o'sha kecha deyarli vafot etdilar
chunki men ajdarni o'ldira olmadim
uzoqlashish yuragimni sindirib tashladi, lekin agar men qilsam, siz xavfsizroq bo'lishingizga ishonardim
qanday tirik qoldingiz?
Jek hech qachon menga yomonlik qilishni xohlamagan
u meni bu erga tegishli deb o'ylagan bo'lishi kerak
hali ham mavjud bo'lgan juda kam sonli kishilardan biri
g'amxo'rlik
orasida
lekin, men siz uchun yuz sochlarini o'stirdim
yashirinmoq
buni tartibga solish mumkin edi
olib kelmoq
qaytadan boshlashimiz mumkinmi?
Endi siz qattiq burilishlarni qilishingiz mumkin
bizni bog'laydi
mendan tush
bu erda isinish
arqonlarni tushiring
Dragoda ular yo'q
menga ishoning
Berk taxtining vorisi
barcha tayyorgarlikni to'xtating
erning ko'proq rivojlanish xilma -xilligi
uni faqat qoziqqa qo'shing
qoziq
siz buni olmoqchi bo'lishingiz mumkin
Men ko'p marta jangni to'xtatishni, boshqa javob topishni iltimos qildim, lekin sizlardan hech kim quloq solmadimi?
Bilaman, men senga Jekni yolg'iz tarbiyalash uchun qoldirganman, lekin u mensiz yaxshi bo'lardi deb o'ylagandim va xato qildim
men seni yo'qotgan kunim kabi go'zalsan
bu kun yomonlashishi mumkinmi?
boshqalarni ogohlantir
achinarli
har bir tuzoqni tekshiring
jim bo'lishda davom eting
endi yaxshilikni qaytarishga ijozat bering
siz buni hech qachon tan olmaysiz
yirtqich dengizlar
cho'kish qo'rquvi bilan
va hayot to'lqinlarini quvonch bilan minib
na kuygan o'g'il, na sovuq
va meni abadiy sev
mening azizim, azizim
sizning kuchli so'zlaringiz meni hayratda qoldirdi
ularni kesib tashlang
u qanday sharmandalikni his qilishi kerak
dunyoni boshqarish uchun
ular odamlarni birlashtira oladigan mehribon, ajoyib ijodkorlar
yoki ularni ajratib oling
Men qo'rquvda yashash nima ekanligini bilaman,
lekin bolaligida ham
hech narsasiz qoldi
men ajdarlardan qo'rqishdan ustun turishga va bu dunyo odamlarini ozod qilishga qasam ichdim
qutulmoq
hech bir ajdaho Alfaning buyrug'iga qarshi tura olmaydi
haqiqiy kuchga guvoh bo'ling
undan chiqib ketish
odamlarni to'plang va meni Berkda kutib oling
va men, men o'ylagan tinchlikparvar emas
siz juda yomon narsa edingiz
juda zaif, juda nozik
Men bunga erisha olmasligingizdan qo'rqardim
u hech qachon shubha qilmagan
ajdaho ruhi
Men otam bo'lishdan juda qo'rqardim ADAMGA OXSHASHDAN
asosan men hech qachon qila olmayman deb o'ylaganim uchun
qanday qilib kimgadir aylanasiz
jasur
fidoyi
O'ylaymanki, siz faqat urinib ko'rishingiz mumkin
Ba'zilar bu noto'g'ri o'ylangan deb taxmin qilishlari mumkin
mumkin emas
endi sizni hech kim himoya qila olmaydi
Men ajablantira olmaydigan tirik ajdaho yo'q
Albatta, sizdan qutulish qiyin, men aytaman
ular sizni shunday qilishga majburlashdi
kutib turing
deyarli u erda do'stim
Menga ishonasanmi?
bitta kabi
Siz meni hayratda qoldirishdan to'xtamaysiz
u erda juda yaxshi ajdaho janjallashdi
hurmatga sazovor bo'lardim
sizning otangiz, u ham men kabi faxrlanardi
siz hali ham shunday qilyapsiz
bu kulgili
biroz oyoq osti qilingan va busted va muz bilan qoplangan, lekin u uy
bizga hujum qilganlar tinimsiz va aqldan ozgan"""

b = f"""granted, it may not look like much, but this wet heap of rock pack
more than a few surprises
just not for the faint of heart
faint
you, see where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling or needlepoint, we dragon racing prefer
folks 
a little something we like to call dragon racing
it's starting to stink around here
stink
nope, still hates you.
let's blow this place
blow
scared him off with the big talk, didn't you
didn't she try to bury you alive?
only for a few hours
now, dragons used to be a bit of a problem here, but that was five years ago
and, really, why would't they
we have custom stables, all you can eat feeding stations, a full service dragon wash
even top of the line fire prevention, if i do say so myself
we can still win this thing
up
here you go, darling
except for me
quit trying to steal all my glory
always ruining everything
that's my future daughter in law
berk is pretty much perfect
all of my hard work has paid off
the world just got a whole lot bigger
you want to give this another shot
this is amazing
no longer amazing
that really came out of nowhere
we got to work on your solo gliding  there
solo
gliding
locked up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers
do you want an apology
is that why you're pout, big baby boo
well, try this on
oh, you feeling it yet? 
picking up on all my geartfelt remorse?
and it's ugly
you know that doesn't wash out
what do you reckon
the odd whispering death or twho in the rocks
whispering
maybe we'll finally track down another Night Fury
wouldn't that be something
wouldn't something
just keep going
what else
avoiding my dad
you're gonna love this
terible terrors are singing on the rooftop
i saunter down to breakfast thinking all is right with the world, and i get
i got  a whole day of goofing off to get started
that's a really flattering impersonation
you're the pride of Berk, son
i'm pretty impressed with myself, too
and since no chief could ask for a better successor
i've decided
sensitive
it's a lot of responsibility
all those speeches and planning and running the village that's his thing
i think you're missing the point
what an honor
i'd be pretty excited
i'm still looking
i know that i'm not my father
what does that make me
stay close
look out
watch the tail
tail
tie those legs up
thought they were all gone for good
looks like our luck's had a turn for the better, lads
look, we don't want any trouble
blasted
trap
sneaking
rescue
you mean other than your thieving friend from last night?
ice-spitting
but we still have a quota to fill
how do you suppose we explain this mess to drago Bludvist
does anything you say make sense?
he's expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow
and Drago don't take well to excuses
promised
far less
we don't know anything about a dragon thief
strange
hostile
oh, where are my manners
finest  dragon trapper alive
capture
rush'em, lads
you will never hold on to those dragons
he's probably flown off the edge of the world by now
you sure want that kid running the village
you can still delay your retirement
who finally decided to show up for work
sorry, got held up
something you're itching to tell me?
uh, not quite the thing you're thinking of, but, yes
a chief first duty is to his people
well, can we just talk in private for
hey, i was ahead of you
if we could just talk
i want one of those high seaters with lots of spikes and a big storage compartment
dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles
no task is too small when it comes to serving your people
you let the forge die down again
you're going up for adoption
have away
i really need to tell you about this neew land we came across
we didn't stick around to find out
these folks weren't particularly friendly
your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder didn't bring them 
cheering to the rooftops
hills
these guys were trappers
you should have seen their fort
it was weird
and worst of all, they thought we did it
not everyone appreciates this way of life
best  we keep to our own.
besides, you'll have more important uses for your time
once we make the big announcement
i'll bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon
you're such a moron
seal the gates
lower the storm doors
wait,because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land
because Drago Bludvist is a madman without conscience or without mercy
get them into their pens
then let's ride back out there
we fortify the island
it's our duty to keep the peace
peace is over
i must prepare you for war
mind
secure the stables
latch every stall
i have to
keep your eyes peeled, lads
with this wind, we'll reach Drago by daybreak
so best we fill this ship up with dragons, and quick
it's no time to be picky
off the port quarter
net them, lads 
take them down
up on the left
and here i was, worried we might turn up empty handed
we give up
finest
that ought to make the boss happy
excuse us
the dragons don't really care for scamped spaces
they'll just hang out with you
trouble
unless you do that wooden boats how is your swimming can't have armed prisoners once they see you as one of their own, even the tastiest dragons can be trained
he can be really persuasive
once you've earned his loyalty, there is nothing a dragon won't do for you
see how well i protect and provide
what is with all the nets?
close
hold your fire
we're here to rescue you
enough
well, didn't you just pick the wrong ship
get this thing off me
that's what i figured
saddle up
of all the irresponsible
i'm trying to protect our dragons and stop a war
how is that irresponsible
there was a great gathering of chieftains to discuss the dragon scouge we all faced
into our midst came a stranger from a strange land, covered in scars and draped in a cloak of dragon skin
scars
draped
cloak
he carried no weapon and spoke softly
devoted to freeing mankind from the tyranny of dragons
we chose to bow down and follow him
we laughed too
until
cried
descended
burning
i was the only one to escape
men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with
i'm still going to try
leak the others back to Berk
i've had enough mutiny for one day
no sudden moves
hold on
you left my dragon back there
he'll drown
we have to head back for my dragon
the dragon thief
you really had me worried there
could it be?
how is this possible?
you were only a babe
boar headed
just like his mother
she could never stay put, either
i mean, could there be a worse combination
when i think of how stubborn and senseless you were back in the day 
do you grasp how insane it sounds
grasp
insane
you've been rescuing them
unbelivable
you're not upset
it's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank
feral
vigilante
crazy
at least i'm not boring, right
well, i suppose there is that one specific thing
oh, incredible
he might very well be the last of his kind
no wonder you get along so well
and retractable teeth
how did you manage
wounded
Jeck had her wing sliced by razor netting
scared
he got me back
pretty soon, everyone back home had dragons of their own
if only it were possible
but people are not capable of change
peace was possible
you'll make it worse
it was a very unpopular opinion
in the cradle
i rushed to protect you
but what i saw was proof of everything i believed
this wasn't a vicious beast, but an intelligent, gentle crearure, whose soul reflected my own
hold on
you and your father nearly died that night
all because i couldn't kill a dragon
it broke my heart to stay away, but i belived you'd be safer if i did
how did you survive
Jack never meant to harm me
he must have thought i belonged here
one of the very few that still exist
care
among
but, i grew facial hair for you
sneak
that could be arranged
fetch
can we start over?
now you can make those tight turns
it bonds us
get off me
keeping warm up here
drop the ropes
Drago doesn't have them after all
trust me
heir to the throne of Berk
stop all preparations
more of the earth shattering development variety
just add it to pile
pile
you might want to take this one
i pleaded so many times to stop the fighting, to find another answer, but did any of you listen?
i know that i left you to raise Jeck alone, but i thought he'd be better off without me, and i was wrong
you're as beautiful as the day i lost you
could this day get any worse?
warn the others
pathetic
check every trap
keep cranking
now let me return the favor
you'd never even recognize it
savage seas
with ne'er a fear of drowning
and gladly ride the waves of life
no scorching son nor freezing cold
and love me for eternity
my dearest one, my darling dear
your mighty words astound me
cut them down
what shame he must feel
to rule the world
they are kind, amazing creaturs that can bring people together
or teat them apart
i know what it is to live in fear, 
but even as a boy
left with nothing
i vowed to rise above the fear of dragons and liberate the people of this world
rid
no dragon can resist the Alpha's command
witness true strength
snap out of it
gather the men and meet me at berk
and i', not the peacekeeper i thought i was
you were such a wee thing
so frail, so fragile
i feared you wouldn't make it
he never doubted
the soul of a dragon
i was so afraid of becoming my dad ADAMGA OXSHASHDAN
mostly because i thought i never could
how do you become someone
brave
selfless
i guess you can only try
some might suggest this is poorly conceived
not possible
no one can protect you now
there isn't a dragon alive that i can't wrangle
you certainly are hard to get rid of, i'll say that
they made you do it
hang on
almost there budy
do you trust me?
as one
you never cease to amaze me
that was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there
i'd be honored
your father, he'd be every bit as proud as i am
you're still doing that one
that's hilarious
